# Technical Incident Report: Lateral Movement via PsExec
- Analyst Name: Kyle I.
- Date of Analysis: 4/7/2025
- Incident Reference: PCAP Review â€“ psexec-hunt.pcapng
### Executive Summary
The Security Operations Center (SOC) detected an alert from the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) indicating potential lateral movement involving PsExec, a known remote administration tool often abused by threat actors. A full packet capture (psexec-hunt.pcapng) was analyzed in Wireshark. The analysis confirms that an internal host (10.0.0.130) performed unauthorized lateral movement to at least two machines within the network, using stolen credentials and deploying a remote execution service (PSEXESVC.exe).

## Detailed Analysis
**1. Initial Access and Lateral Movement**
- The attacker initiated a connection from IP 10.0.0.130 to 10.0.0.133 over TCP port 445.
- SMB2 negotiation and NTLM authentication were completed using the compromised credentials of user \ssales.
- This form of NTLM authentication is commonly abused during lateral movement, especially using tools like PsExec.

**2. Host Enumeration and Network Share Access**
- The attacker connected to the IPC$ and ADMIN$ shares on 10.0.0.133.
- These are administrative shares used for inter-process communication and file transfer during remote execution.

**3. Remote Payload Deployment**
- PsExec dropped the file PSEXESVC.exe onto the target.
- This binary was written without any access denied response, indicating the credentials had sufficient administrative rights.

#### Observed Packets

```
Create Request File: PSEXESVC.exe
Write Request File: PSEXESVC.exe
```

**4. System Identification via NTLM Challenge**
- During NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE responses, the following system hostnames were leaked:

#### Target IP	Hostnames:
- 10.0.0.133	SALES-PC
- 10.0.0.131	MARKETING-PC
This confirmed that the attacker moved laterally from SALES-PC to MARKETING-PC.

**5. Second Pivot Attempt**
- The attacker continued from `10.0.0.130` to `10.0.0.131` (MARKETING-PC).
- NTLM authentication was attempted again using the same credentials.
- Successful NTLMSSP negotiation confirmed the second host compromise.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

The attacker successfully moved laterally using **PsExec**, exploiting **SMB** with valid credentials (`ssales`) to access `SALES-PC` and `MARKETING-PC`. Their activity involved authentication, remote service installation (`PSEXESVC.exe`), and likely remote command execution.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Credential Reset**  
   Immediately reset and investigate accounts involved (`ssales`).

2. **Network Segmentation**  
   Limit administrative SMB access between workstations.

3. **Audit Admin Shares**  
   Restrict and monitor use of `ADMIN$`, `IPC$`.

4. **Deploy Endpoint Detection**  
   Use EDR tools to detect remote service creation (PsExec behavior).

5. **Harden NTLM Usage**  
   - Disable or restrict NTLM where possible  
   - Implement SMB signing

6. **Enable Logging & Monitoring**  
   Enable security auditing for service creation, authentication, and process creation.

7. **Threat Hunt**  
   Search for signs of `PSEXESVC.exe` and similar remote admin tools across the network.
